### Minimum Viable Product

## Project Overview
* We aim to create a hub for convenient, free tutoring
* We also hope to preserve a legacy in the form of food
  - This includes recipes, history and a family's connection to a dish
  - It also may include local attractions or services to visit
* Tutoring can be boring and quality lessons are usually expensive
  - Our organization will provide quality teaching and a fun experience
  - This would increase accessibility of tutoring for everyone

## MVP definition
* In order to achieve our goals:
  - We must create an appealing website
  - Maintain and document our quality lessons
  - Allow clients to easily sign up
  - Make a calendar that saves appointments on the cloud and notifies clients and tutors
* This was decided through discussion with our clients and amongs the devs
* It is also needed so that clients can sign up without much hassle

## Progress
* Overall, our progress has been slow so far
* We are slowly chipping away at learning web development
* As of late, CSS has become integral for an "appealing website"
* The main struggle on the back end is learning to do file I/O with Excel spreadsheets (for calendar)

## Timeline
* We hope to finish the website before applying to our Regular Decision colleges
* In the event we finish early, we will continue adding QOL features
  - This may include:
    - The addition of a map showcasing the range of tutors
    - A login system
    - Applications for aspiring tutors

## Demonstrations
* Demos are up for view on replit
* A dynamic navbar is currently a highlighted feature we are working to develop
* There exists a workbook made with ExcelJS, but is currently not very useable without file I/O
* The workbook has columns for date, time, name, email, subject, and tutor for each scheduled session

## Documentation
* Much of our project is shared together in this Github repository
  - Logs
  - Project Goals
  - Skeleton Website
* We are both coding indpendently on replit (Luke - front end, Aleksey - back end), with shared consultation

## Reflections
* We have learned that website development is no easy task
* We are currently learning the popular HTML, CSS and JS languages
* If we were to start again, we would take a course on coding
* On the back end, it would be nicer if the file structure was neater from the start

##Todo
- add better captions to the slideshow (potentially dynamic ones that the user can interact with)
- get some better pictures for the tutors
- make sign-up form more appealing
- change our messages on Home page to make them more meaningful
