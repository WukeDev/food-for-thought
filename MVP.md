### Minimum Viable Product

## Project Overview
* We aim to create a hub for tutoring
* We also hope to preserve a legacy in the form of food
  - This includes recipes, history and a family's connection to a dish
  - It also may include local attractions or services to visit
* Tutoring can be boring and quality lessons are usually expensive
  - Our organization will provide quality teaching and a fun experience

## MVP definitino
* In order to achieve our goals:
  - We must create an appealing website
  - Maintain and document our quality lessons
  - Allow clients to easily sign up
* This was decided through discussion with our clients and amongs the devs

## Progress
* Overall, our progress has been slow so far
* We are slowly chipping away at learning web development
* As of late, CSS has become integral for an "appealing website"

## Timeline
* We hope to finish the website before applying to our Regular Decision colleges
* In the event we finish early, we will continue adding QOL features
  - This may include:
    - The addition of a map showcasing the range of tutors
    - A login system
    - Applications for aspiring tutors

## Demonstrations
* Demos are up for view on replit
* A dynamic navbar is currently a highlighted feature we are working to develop

## Documentation
* Much of our project is shared together in this Github repository
  - Logs
  - Project Goals
  - Skeleton Website
* We are both coding indpendently on replit, with shared consultation

## Reflections
* We have learned that website development is no easy task
* We are currently learning the popular HTML, CSS and JS languages
* If we were to start again, we would take a course on coding
