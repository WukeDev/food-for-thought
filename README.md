### Food For Thought

## Hook
A free tutoring website with a yummy twist!

## Plan
Throughout this project, we will be exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create a polished website with an intuitive GUI.
We aim to provide the best tutoring experience possible for an unbeatable price. **FREE!**
Nothing is free though sadly. During the first tutoring session, we hope to be introduced to an aspect of you through food. Whether it be your culture, your tastes or something you just enjoy doing. We plan to cover all topics of school with the standard Math, Science and Reading curriculum, but with even more. In addition to the core subjects, we offer SAT and ACT tutoring, engineering advice, public speaking help and even more!

## Features
- Properly implemented form for tutoring candidates
- Potential database for users and tutors
- Looking to expand to multiple locations worldwide
- Multiple Tutors with a large breadth of expertise
- Hundreds of tutoring hours in experience

## Problem
We aim to address the problem of a challenging education system.

## AI Integration
AI could potentially be used for generating ideas, guiding development, and in the actual creation of certain parts of the website.

## Task List
- Research ways to tutor effectively
- Investigate ways to make it easy to schedule appointments
- Finish the website design

## Timeline
- The first task would probably be ongoing for most of the duration of the project, since we hope to continuously improve our tutoring skills
- This should take around a week to finalize the method and anywhere from a week to two weeks to implement
- This would probably be ongoing throughout the semester, since we would constantly want to touch up the website, but the main bulk of it should take around three weeks, since the appointment scheduling system would have to be implemented into the website
