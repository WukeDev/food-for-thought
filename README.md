### Food For Thought

## Hook
A free tutoring website with a yummy twist!

## Plan
Throughout this project, we will be exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create a polished website with an intuitive GUI.
We aim to provide the best tutoring experience possible for an unbeatable price. FREE!
Nothing is free though sadly. During the first tutoring session, we hope to be introduced to an aspect of you through food. Whether it be your culture, your tastes or something you just enjoy doing. We plan to cover all topics of school with the standard Math, Science and Reading curriculum, but with even more. In addition to the core subjects, we offer SAT and ACT tutoring, engineering advice, public speaking help and even more!

## Features
- Properly implemented form for tutoring candidates
- Potential database for users and tutors
- Looking to expand to multiple locations worldwide
- Multiple Tutors with a large breadth of expertise
- Hundreds of tutoring hours in experience
