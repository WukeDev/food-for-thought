### Food For Thought

## Hook
A free tutoring website with a yummy twist!

## Plan
Throughout this project, we will be exploring HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create a polished website with an intuitive GUI.
We aim to provide the best tutoring experience possible for an unbeatable price. **FREE!**
Nothing is free though sadly. During the first tutoring session, we hope to be introduced to an aspect of you through food. Whether it be your culture, your tastes or something you just enjoy doing. We plan to cover all topics of school with the standard Math, Science and Reading curriculum, but with even more. In addition to the core subjects, we offer SAT and ACT tutoring, engineering advice, public speaking help and even more!

## Features
- Properly implemented form for tutoring candidates
- Potential database for users and tutors
- Looking to expand to multiple locations worldwide
- Multiple Tutors with a large breadth of expertise
- Hundreds of tutoring hours in experience

## Problem
- We aim to satiate the hunger for knowledge that students may have.
- after tutoring sessions, many times both the student and tutor are hungry. To solve this, we propose the student teaches the tutor about some food
- It could be the student's favorite snack, a cultural dish or anything in between. All foods are welcome!
- As tutors, we plan to learn more about the food and document everything on the website
- Our main goal is to make tutoring less boring and more **tasty**

## AI Integration
AI could potentially be used for generating ideas, guiding development, and in the actual creation of certain parts of the website. As of now, we plan to learn web development on our own, but AI could prove useful in teaching us.

1. Use and hone our tutoring skills
2. Implement forms for scheduling and data entry
